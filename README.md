# Tiger Island v3.2 Team F
Tiger Island is a two-player tile-placement game assigned as a project by Dave Small. 

What we have done:

Rules:
 All rules are implemented as of version 3.2 on the website.
 
AI:
AI has the capabilities of placing the following:
 Villagers
 Totoros
 
 We had a last minute bug that prevented us from implementing TigerPlayground. We chose staying connected to the server over this.
 We also have an AI version with expansions but were not able to thoroughly test this version before 04/14/17 tournament.

Server Connection:
 Our client connects to the server and plays through all rounds and challenges whether the opponent win/forfeits/loses or we   win/forfeit/lose.
 
 There is a bug in server connection if there is an odd number of players.
